Abstract:
       The concept of integrating common services for common people aims to streamline access to essential public services through centralized platforms. This abstract explores the rationale, benefits, and challenges associated with such integration. By consolidating services ranging from healthcare and education to administrative tasks like licensing and registration, governments can enhance efficiency, reduce redundancy, and improve citizen satisfaction. However, achieving seamless integration requires overcoming technological, organizational, and regulatory barriers. This abstract underscores the importance of stakeholder collaboration, robust digital infrastructure, and user-centric design in successfully implementing integrated service delivery models
Requirement analysis:
Functional Requirements

Service Integration: The system should seamlessly integrate various public services such as healthcare, education, social services, licensing, and permits into a unified platform.
User Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure methods for user authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and role-based access control to ensure data security and privacy.
Service Access and Navigation: Provide intuitive interfaces and navigation pathways that allow users to easily access and navigate through different services.
Transaction Processing: Enable users to initiate and complete transactions online, such as applying for permits, paying taxes, scheduling appointments, and tracking application statuses.

1.Non-Functional Requirements:

Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data, including encryption, secure APIs, and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Usability: Ensure the system is user-friendly, accessible, and meets accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to cater to users with disabilities.
Compliance: Adhere to legal and regulatory requirements related to data privacy, security, accessibility, and service delivery standards.

Stack holders and their needs

Government Agencies: Need a unified platform to streamline service delivery, reduce operational costs, and enhance efficiency in service provision.
Citizens: Require easy access to a wide range of public services through a user-friendly interface, with minimal bureaucracy and waiting times.
Businesses: Benefit from streamlined processes for licenses, permits, and regulatory compliance, fostering a conducive business environment.
IT Departments: Need robust technological infrastructure and interoperable systems to support seamless data exchange and integration.
Regulatory Bodies: Require adherence to standards and regulations governing data privacy, security, and service delivery.

System design:

1.High-Level Architecture of the System:
Presentation Layer: Interfaces and user interfaces (UIs) through which users interact with the system. This could include web portals, mobile apps, and kiosks designed for accessibility and ease of use.
Infrastructure Layer: Includes servers, networking components, and cloud services (if applicable) that support the scalability, reliability, and performance of the system.
Data layer: centralized data about household common problem and their solutions. Data about handyman, electrical, plumbing, carpenter, painting, cleaning, roof services.
Website layer: Business logic and service orchestration layer that handles service and workflow management.
2.Detailed design diagram:
Component Diagram: Illustrates the modular structure of the system, showing how different modules (e.g., user interface, business logic, data access) interact and communicate.
Sequence Diagrams: Depict the sequence of interactions between system components and external actors (e.g., users, external services) for specific use cases. This helps visualize the flow of operations within the system.
Communication Diagrams: Detail the communication protocols and interfaces used between system components and external systems/APIs.

Implementation:
Technologies and tools used:
Java script -   JavaScript is a dynamic, multi-paradigm programming language widely used in web development. It is lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded, allowing for both client-side and server-side scripting. JavaScript enables developers to create interactive and dynamic web page content, manipulate HTML and CSS, and validate and manipulate data. It's an interpreted language, making it flexible and powerful for a variety of applications, including web and game development [1] [2] [3] [5].

Html 5- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It describes the structure and presentation of web content using a series of elements and tags. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements and attributes to improve the capabilities and flexibility of web development.


Boostrap - Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end development framework designed to facilitate the creation of responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications. It includes a comprehensive collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that simplify the process of developing user interfaces.

CSS - CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be displayed on a web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and overall design.

Json- JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and a web application as text. JSON is language-independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others .


Web fonts
oDevelop environment setup:
oVS CODE(VISUAL STUDIO CODE)

IMPLEMENT DETAILS:
Linked the official website of carpentering works,painting works, handyman works etc..
Linked the social website for our website to get the better working and satisfies our customer.





Testing and Testing methodologies:
Unit Testing: Test individual components of the website, such as forms, buttons, and links, to ensure they function correctly .
Integration Testing: Verify that different modules and services within the website work together seamlessly. This includes testing interactions between the front-end and back-end components.
System Testing: Test the complete and integrated website to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This involves checking the overall functionality, usability, and performance of the website .
Regression Testing: Re-test the website after changes or updates to ensure that new code does not negatively affect existing functionality.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate the website's functionality from the end-user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and expectations. This involves real-world scenarios and user feedback.
Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure that the website functions correctly across different browsers and devices. This involves testing the website on various browser versions and screen resolutions .

Functional Testing:
Content Management: Test adding, editing, deleting, and organizing content.
Compatibility Testing:
Cross-Browser Testing: Test on popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
